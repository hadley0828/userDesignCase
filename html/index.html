                <p>Nowadays, the world is experiencing an unprecedented pandemic.
                    People used to go outside for eating, but now the ways to get
                    food are much different. However,  it is difficult for many people
                    to cook food at the same caliber as restaurant cuisine because of
                    their lack of experience. Our team aims to design a system that
                    can guide people to be a better cook, and can provide support
                    for staying-at-home people a way to ease into cooking.</p>

                        To investigate our user base, we conducted interviews with people that fit our target audience: anyone interested in cooking and is able to perform basic cooking tasks. This usually describes people above the age of 15 and have enough income and time to have a luxury of diving into cooking. Throughout the interview, we aimed to answer several research questions, encompassing ideas like why people want to learn to cook, how they learn to cook, and what keeps them from cooking. We also sought valuable insight on the stance of cooking our interviewees may have. With that information, we identified key goals that our interviewees have in regards to cooking, some of which include having convenient meals and eating healthy, as well as common obstacles like laziness and lack of time.  We then constructed 3 personas to illustrate the goals and behaviors of our users to assist us in making design decisions in the future.

These people often have their full-time work or are full-time university students, so they do not have much time for preparing food. As well, because they are new in living apart from family, they are not very experienced in cooking and want to grow. What’s more, they usually value health in food, which makes them look for a more healthy and more convenient way for cooking. The core goal of our system is to help these types of people ease into cooking, allowing them to fulfill their needs and goals in learning how to cook.

Some types of these people are those who regard cooking as a necessary evil, those who have been cooking for a long time, and those who are highly money-conscious with cooking. Seeking new platforms for cooking guidance might not be their primary choice, but sometimes, they might like to try some new recipes and refer to our system.

Most of the concerns stemmed from ambiguous wording and interactables in the system, which the team prioritized in reflecting in the wireframe. For example, the "Tutorials" tab was renamed to "Skills" due to the confusions stemming from the terminology. Other user confusions involved displaying unneccessary information, such as displaying active filters and allowing insignificant filters, therefore cluttering the filter window.

                For the heuristic evaluation, we individually evaluated the high-fidelity version of Apron we constructed prior. This process involved focusing on focusing on one of Hielsen's 10 Heuristics, uncovering components of the system that seemingly violate the heuristic, documenting it, and repeating for all ten heuristics. Then, similar to the user evaluations, the group collected the usability issues on Miro, and constructed a table listing the issues found ordered by priority, and updated our high fidelity mockup accordingly.

                    Surprisingly, many of the issues found from the individual heuristic evaluation did not match the others. There were about 60 usability issues found through this exercise. However, due to limitations of Figma, the platform this high fidelity mockup was constructed on, some of these usability issues were unreasonable to resolve. In total, the team formulated 19 key issues from the heuristic evaluation that were reflected in the final high fidelity mockup.
