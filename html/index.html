                <p>Nowadays, the world is experiencing an unprecedented pandemic.
                    People used to go outside for eating, but now the ways to get
                    food are much different. However,  it is difficult for many people
                    to cook food at the same caliber as restaurant cuisine because of
                    their lack of experience. Our team aims to design a system that
                    can guide people to be a better cook, and can provide support
                    for staying-at-home people a way to ease into cooking.</p>

                    For the user evaluation, the three team members each interviewed two potential users for a total of six user evaluation interviews. These interviews were conducted with a guildeline in mind, constructed by the team members prior. After we individually collected the interview results, we then used Miro, a virtual whiteboard, to collect and organize the notes obtained from said interviews. We then constructed a table listing the issues found ordered by priority, and updated our existing wireframe accordingly.

                    In total, the team formulated 13 key issues from the user evaluations. Most of the concerns stemmed from ambiguous wording and interactables in the system, which the team prioritized in reflecting in the wireframe. For example, the "Tutorials" tab was renamed to "Skills" due to the confusions stemming from the terminology. Other user confusions involved displaying unneccessary information, such as displaying active filters and allowing insignificant filters, therefore cluttering the filter window.

                Methods
            </h4>
            For the heuristic evaluation, we individually evaluated the high-fidelity version of Apron we constructed prior. This process involved focusing on focusing on one of Hielsen's 10 Heuristics, uncovering components of the system that seemingly violate the heuristic, documenting it, and repeating for all ten heuristics. Then, similar to the user evaluations, the group collected the usability issues on Miro, and constructed a table listing the issues found ordered by priority, and updated our high fidelity mockup accordingly.
            <h4>
                Findings

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
                    Surprisingly, many of the issues found from the individual heuristic evaluation did not match the others. There were about 60 usability issues found through this exercise. However, due to limitations of Figma, the platform this high fidelity mockup was constructed on, some of these usability issues were unreasonable to resolve. In total, the team formulated 19 key issues from the heuristic evaluation that were reflected in the final high fidelity mockup.
